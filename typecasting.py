#What is Type casting ? 

#example:

a = "1"
b = "2"
print(a+b) #this is typecasting 

#Python use a wide varity of functions or methods like: init() ,float() ,str(), ord() , hex() , 

print(int(a) + int(b))

#Two type of type Casting
#1) Explicit : Done by me using method example is above
#2) Implicit : Done by python

#! Implicit type casting 
x = 9.9 # data type is float 
y = 1 #data type is integer

print(x+y) #this data is implicitly change by python from inter to float
